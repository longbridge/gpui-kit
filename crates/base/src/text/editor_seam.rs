//! Minimal editor seam on the shared text renderer (design Phase 0a, D3).
//!
//! A text leaf whose [`InlineState`](super::inline::InlineState) carries an
//! `editor_key` reports its laid-out [`TextLayout`] to the editor sink that
//! is installed for the duration of the editor's prepaint, and takes extra
//! range backgrounds (the editor's selection) from it. `TextView` never sets
//! a key or installs a sink, so read-only rendering is unchanged. The module
//! (and `InlineState::editor_key`) only exists with the `block-editor`
//! feature; without it there is no per-frame cost at all.
//!
//! The sink is frame-local: it is written during prepaint and read by the
//! editor's own handlers; nothing here reaches back into an entity.
